        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Education:</strong><br>
            2013 PhD in Architectural Studies, Faculty of Design and Architecture, University Putra Malaysia, MALAYSIA<br>
            1996 B. A. and M.A. in Architecture, Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Tehran, IRAN
        </p>
        <p>I possess a Ph.D. in Architectural Studies from the University Putra Malaysia and a Master's 
        degree in Architectural Engineering from the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Tehran. 
        Additionally, I have been a faculty member at Eqbal Lahoori Institute of Higher Education for 13 years. My research explores vernacular architecture, archi-tourism, and urban studies, applying them to address scientific and business challenges. With more than two decades of experience as a first-class registered architect, I validate the viability of my concepts by leveraging my expertise in these fields and incorporating them into the architectural and urban design of numerous projects. Furthermore, I have actively participated as a scholar in various conferences and served as a jury in tourism film festivals and architectural competitions, both at national and international levels.</p>
